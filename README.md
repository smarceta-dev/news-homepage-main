### Overview
This was a challenge created by www.frontendmentor.io where you're given the design of a website and have to code it up from scratch. 

The only information you are given is a screenshot of the mobile and web version of the page, and a description of the functionality. 

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Continued development

Going forward I plan to refactor some of the code to make it more readable. I also plan to add SASS to the project instead of CSS as this would provide better orginization and readability to the project. For the HTML I plan to implement a proper naming convention for the class names. Finally, I plan to update the page to make it more response (media queries) and add a mobile version.
